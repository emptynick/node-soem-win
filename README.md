# Simple Open EtherCAT Master for Node.js

## Installation

Run the following in a x64 Visual Studio developer console

`npm install node-soem`

Make sure to have `git` and `cmake` installed on you system. The installation process builds a shared library from the [Simple Open EtherCAT Master](https://github.com/openethercatsociety/soem).

## API

Basically following the C API.

### Creating a master.

    var soem = require('node-soem').NodeSoemMaster,
        master = soem(); // uses eth0 initially

### Example

    // initiate socket and stuff
    if (master.init()) {
    
        // send out some ethercat frames to configure slaves
        master.configInit();

        // map the slave pdos to the internal ioMap
        master.configMap();
    
        // configure distributed clocks
        master.configDC();

        // take a look at the bus configuration
        var slaves = master.getSlaves();

        console.log(slaves);

        // get ready to send some initial data befor going to operational state
        master.sendProcessdata();
        maste.receiveProcessdata();

        // go to operational state
        master.writeState(0, 4); // 0=all slaves, 4=operational state

        // wait for the master to reach operational state

        var waitForOp = function () {
        
            var intv = setInterval(function () {
            
                master.sendProcessdata();
                master.receiveProcessdata();
                
                var state = master.statecheck(0, 4);
                
                // operational state reached
                if (state === 4) {
                    clearInterval(intv);
                    loop();    
                } 
                
            }, 50);    
            
        }

        var loop = function () {
       
            var counter = 0,
                slaves = master.getSlaves(),
                dv = new DataView(slaves[0].outputs);
        
            var intv = setInterval(function () {
     
                master.sendProcessdata();
                master.receiveProcessdata();
               
                dv.setUint16(0, counter++); 
                           
                
            }, 50);   
            
        }
    
        waitForOp();

    }
